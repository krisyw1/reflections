How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it showed only the edited areas of the program

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    i can see exactly where and when changes were made, 
    so matching when bugs started and what changes made them

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros, it's open (use and file types/programs to edit), con, i wont remember to
    at the right times

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

     because one change could effect the entire set of files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log -  see all changes, diff - see difrences between files (click and rclick
    for copy and paste)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It will allow me go back, incase the changes causes bugs or failure

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    to keep regular back ups of my working files =]
